About:

     One of the biggest challenges that Singapore faces today is its 
     increasingly ageing population. While we had one of the highest life 
     expectancies in the world in 2018, we also had one of the lowest fertility
     rates. This puts pressure on our society to support our ageing population.
     
     When we reach a certain age in our life where we’re way past our glory days,
     seniors often feel like they have lost a part of their “young and adventurous”
     self. From a healthcare perspective, many elderly people may have physical
     limitations, where they are not able to do the usual things that they would
     do, and can even begin to feel enslaved to the ageing process. But growing
     older does not always have to be seen in a bad light.
      
     Our aim of this project is to tackle two out of the three pillars of active
     ageing which are: Optimizing opportunities for health and Participation.
     We have decided to approach this through an online game which promotes the 
     stimulation of the minds of participants as they are required to maintain a
     high level of concentration and develop strategies in order to win. Thus, 
     keeping their mind active which helps maintain their mental wellbeing.
     
     Additionally, we have also encouraged interaction amongst participants 
     through the use of a forum where they are able to chat with each other 
     freely while practicing good cyber wellness habits.
